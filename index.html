		<h1> History </h1>
        	<p> Brainwave Worldwide was founded in 1993 with the vision of bringing easily accessible education to children across the globe. We are a non-profit institution that uses donations to acquire educational material and distubute it to those in need. Milton Foster, the CEO and founder, has always been dedicated to education. He was an English teacher at John Brown High School in New York for thirty-two years before he transitioned into the non-profit space. The company started off with physical copies of educational material, but has since shifted its focus to access to education through technology. </p>
        	<h2> Why Use Us? </h2>
        	<p>While we encourage all donations to any non-profits with a focus on education, we strongly believe that we have the most selfless and hardworking team out there, and we are commited to improving every single day. We have multiple teams that focus on redistribution of extra materials, creation of new materials, acquisition of rights to materials, and much more so that we can properly educate the entire world.</p>
